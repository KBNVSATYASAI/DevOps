Configuration Management :- (Ansible)

-> puppet   Vs        Ansible
    pull              push
   agent             agentless
                    it has windows and Linux friendly
puppet language         YAML language 


  Sudo -> It is used to make the root previlages active .





sudo apt install ansible

ansible --version


set up password less authentication-------> 


Inventry file --> it used to store the ip's of the target servers

Ansible Adhoc commands VS Ansible playbook 

Ansible Adhoc commands :- it has some modules and in it it has some arguments. to create the resources and execute the tasks in servers.

ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch firstfile.shell"

ansible -i inventory  all -m "shell" -a "nproc"

and we can group the servers by using "[group name]" below server to that group.
ex:-
and command :- ansible -i inventory webservers -m "shell" -a "touch firstfile.shell"
                ansible -i inventory dbservers -m "shell" -a "touch firstfile.shell"

-> now we can write the playbooks to execute the set of tasks .
-> Yaml language is used to write
-> We have roles to write more efficient in ansible.
-> to run playbook ---> ansible-playbook -i inventory  playbook.yml
