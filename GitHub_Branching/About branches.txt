**About branches**
-------------------
-> Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

-> Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
